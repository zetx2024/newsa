Bangladesh's all-female robots team earned the gold medal in the 2024 World Science, Environment, and Engineering Competition (WSEEC) in Jakarta, Indonesia, yesterday (19 May, 2024).

#### WSEEC Team

Jannatul Ferdous Fabin (team leader), Nusrat Zahan Sinha (team management), Nosrat Jahan Nowrin (hardware), Saniea Islam Sara (software), and Tahia Rahman (project manager) comprise the Code Black team.

Team Code Black has competed in a variety of international robotics events since its establishment in 2021. They are developing agricultural technology goods in their robotics research facility in Banasree, Rampura.

They received the award for its rescue robot, Prohori, which was developed for disaster response and search-and-rescue missions.

It can analyze visual data in real time, detect survivors, assess dangerous circumstances, and traverse complicated settings with unprecedented precision thanks to cutting-edge image processing and AI.

According to the team's Facebook post, the robot was inspired by the book "Nakshi Kanthar Math" by Jasimuddin.

WSEEC is an annual global innovation competition in General Science, Environment, and Engineering, with participants ranging from elementary to university level. This competition especially addresses the following areas: Mathematics, Energy and Engineering, Physics, Natural Sciences, Social Sciences, Environment, and Technology.
