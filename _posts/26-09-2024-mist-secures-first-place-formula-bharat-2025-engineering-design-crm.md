MIST Blitz, the Formula student squad from the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Military Institute of Science and Technology (MIST), has made an impressive start in motorsport engineering. In just a few months after its establishment, the team has already accomplished two key milestones: first place in the Formula Bharat 2025 qualification quiz and first place in the Engineering Design Concept Resources Management (CRM) Combustion Category at the same event.

Formula Bharat is India's foremost student engineering competition, based on the global Formula Student series. University teams design and construct small-scale formula-style race vehicles, competing in areas such as engineering design, cost efficiency, marketability, and so on. 

"MIST Blitz began in March 2024, when five of us from MIST's Mechanical Engineering department began studying vehicle dynamics over our term-end vacation. That desire rapidly drove us to register for Formula Bharat 2025, and our adventure took off from there," explains Tahmid Muntasir, MIST Blitz's team leader. 

MIST Blitz presently has 38 devoted people organized into four core technical sub-teams. Tahmid Muntasir is in charge of the suspension, steering, and brake systems team, while Iram Mustavi Chowdhury and Tausif Nawaz are in charge of the chassis and aerodynamics team, Sakin Islam is in charge of the engine, and Adnan Shahriar is in charge of the electronic control systems team.

Four managerial sub-teams - management and outreach, finance, logistics, and documentation - collaborate with the technical teams to guarantee seamless operations. Maliha Farhin and Nazifa Rafa head the documentation team. Maj Md Anisur Rahman, GSO-2 of the Mechanical Engineering department, and Lecturer Shah Md Ahasan Siddique, who gave steadfast leadership and crucial resources, also contributed to the team's achievement. 

"We are pleased with how swiftly this team has added two feathers to our automobile crown. MIST Blitz is critical for our department because it gives Mechanical Engineering students hands-on experience, helps them develop practical skills, and fosters teamwork, all of which are necessary foundations for future difficulties in the automotive industry," Ahasan stated. 

After competing in Formula Bharat 2025, which will be held at Kari Motor Speedway in India from January 22 to 27, 2025, MIST Blitz plans to target Formula Student UK, organized by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, to enhance their worldwide profile in racing engineering.
